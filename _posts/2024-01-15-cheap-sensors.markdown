**To address greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular methane emission, it is crucial to understand their sources. One effective method for measuring emissions in important but remote areas, like peatlands, is environmental monitoring using low-cost wireless devices. The Figaro NGM2611-E13, a low-cost methane detection module based on the TGS2611-E00 sensor, offers a solution. Although the manufacturer provides sensitivity data for methane concentrations above 300 ppm, lower concentrations are more common in outdoor environments. Researchers are now trying to improve the sensitivity of such devices**

More to come soon...
